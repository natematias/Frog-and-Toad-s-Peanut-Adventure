<h1>What do you do with half a peanut?</h1>
<p>After an hour of arguing. Frog and Toad decide to split the peanut. "After all," concedes Toad, "we can skip twice as many times if we split each peanut."</p><p>"Oh. I thought we might eat the extras", says Frog.</p><p>"How about eating half of the extras, and skipping half of the extras?"</p><p>Frog finally agreed. "we have a lot of peanuts after all; even though we eat 12.5% of the peanuts, we still skip more -and the skip quality per throw is still better than whole peanuts"</p><p>"I'm still not sure about that" said Toad. "Why not take notes and then compare next time?"</p><p>"I'm up for that." It was agreed.</p><p>Frog and Toad began skipping peanuts, taking turns with their notebook. Just as they finished the test and began analysis, Squirrel happened by and heard the word "peanuts." </p><p>Should Squirrel interfere?</p><ul><li> <a href="SquirrelInterferes.html">Click here</a> if you think Squirrel should get involved.</li><li> <a href="FrogandToadWritetheirO_1.html">Click here</a> if you think the test should be uninterrupted, so Frog and Toad can write up their results.</li></ul>
