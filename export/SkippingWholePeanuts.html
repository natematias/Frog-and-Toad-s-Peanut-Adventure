<h1>Skipping Whole Peanuts</h1>
<p>Although Toad's scientific integrity was considerably challenged by his desire to eat the extra halves left from Frog's methodology, the two friends decided to try skipping unsplit peanuts.</p><p>"After all, if we skip the peanuts the whole way across, we might wake up Squirrel with a barrage of peanuts!" chuckles Toad.</p><p>"No way. If we're going to go with your plan, we're not going to waste these peanuts on a silly prank" snapped Frog. "I say we skip the peanuts over there, by the lilly pads. We can use the pads to count just how far the peanuts go."</p><p>"I see you brought your notebook. Why do you have to be so boring?" said an exasperated Toad. "If we had an ethics board, they would like my idea. Sure we would annoy Squirrel, but we could also feed him."</p><p>"You know we're not supposed to feed anyone with our test materials, Toad. If we hit Squirrel, we would have an invalid test, we would be liable for assault, and possibly for food poisoning. Honestly!" </p><ul><li> <a href="FrogandToadWritetheirObs.html">Click here</a> if you think Frog and Toad should prefer a valid, lillypad-measured test instead of annoying Squirrel.</li><li><a href="SquirrelWakesUp.html"> Click here</a> if you agree with Toad and want to annoy Squirrel (and possibly feed him).</li></ul>
