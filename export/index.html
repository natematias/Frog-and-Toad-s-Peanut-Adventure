<h1>Frog and Toad's Peanut Adventure</h1>
<p>Long ago and far away, in the magical forest lived a very scientific Frog, a hungry Toad, and their friend the jumpy Squirrel.</p><p>One day, Frog and Toad sat by the magical pond, debating the best way to skip peanuts across the perfectly-still waters.</p><p>Frog believed that the peanuts should be cracked in half, and that the flat inside the of the peanut was the perfect skipping surface.</p><p>Toad disagreed. He thought that the round peanut outside was just right for maximum skippage. Cracking the peanut would just mess things up.</p><ul><li> <a href="Whatdoyoudowithhalfapean.html">Click here</a> if you agree with Frog and want to split the peanut.</li><li> <a href="SkippingWholePeanuts.html">Toad is right</a>.
