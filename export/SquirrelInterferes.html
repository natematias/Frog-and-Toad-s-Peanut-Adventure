<h1>Squirrel Interferes</h1>
<p>The lure of peanuts is simply too much to resist. Squirrel hops over the moss, up a tree, across a branch, and slides down the massive fern which is Frog and Toad's umbrella.</p><p>Frog is just finishing the first sentence of analysis. "... as you can see, reliable usage of the flat undersurface relies on the angle of incidence and rotation."</p><p>As squirrel rides the fern to the ground and lets go, the stem snaps upward, showering Frog and Toad and their notebook with drops of water and thousands of icky spores.</p><p>"Hi guys. Did I hear that you had peanuts? Can I have some, huh what?" Before he even finishes the sentence, Squirrel learns that frogs and toads are capable of glowering.</p><p>Can they mend their relationship and go on to do Science another day? Only <i>they</i> can decide that.</p>
