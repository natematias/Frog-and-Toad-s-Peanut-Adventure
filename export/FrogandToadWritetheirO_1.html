<h1>Frog and Toad Write their Observations</h1>
<p>Frog taps his notebook with satisfaction as he finishes the final sentence. "... as you can see, reliable skippage of peanuts relies on the angle of incidence and rotation as much as the shape of the contact surface."</p><p>Toad nods sagely as he munches on a peanut. "I think we have it. Perfectly conclusive. I wish Squirrel were here; he knows about nuts and might have some ideas of his own to add."</p><p>Frog ponders. "Why not wake him up? He's just a few hops away, and might be able to help us expand to acorns, or maybe even walnuts."</p><p>Toad gets up and they start off. "This was fun; we didn't even argue as much as normal. Oh, by the way, can I be the first author?"</p>
